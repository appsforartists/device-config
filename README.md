 This is me trying to remember all the stuff I did to turn my Pixel into a web dev machine.  Hopefully, I can save you a couple days of your life experimenting with all sorts of Linuxy stuff before you can be productive.

TODO:

 - Remove everything I didn't change in Soda Dark.sublime-theme.  Most retina Sublime themes seem to be based on Soda, so hopefully I can create a scaffold that will teach Sublime where to find Retina assets for any Sublime theme.
 
 - Test the .sh scripts

 - Combine both scripts

 - Documentation
