# Welcome to `appsforartists/device-config`!

This repo is where I experiment with potentially esoteric device setups.  It was previously used to [run Sublime Text on a Chromebook Pixel](../../tree/pixel-webdev), and [try NixOS on a Lenovo Legion Go](../../tree/nixos).  Now, I'm using it to hold the Nix Home Manager config for SteamOS on the same Legion Go.
